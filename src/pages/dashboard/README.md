# Dashboard

The Dashboard Page shows the contents of `Page`, and will most commonly be navigated to from `ListMasterPage`.

Please note that this could be done as a generic page two, but in regards to the importance of this page a separation is recommended.

The Dashboard consits of three functional sections:

## Blogposts

Displays the most recent post and a list of the top 5 blog posts in CWORLD (space).
Additional links there for the departments blogs "food","pharma","labels"

## Links

These links were called 'color-boxes' in the desktop version. Ordered alphabetically.

## Meta

Meta information about that page.
